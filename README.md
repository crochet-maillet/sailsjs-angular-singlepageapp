#SailsJS + Angular single page app

This is an example of a single page app using sailsjs and angularjs. The intention was to show how easy it is to integrate the two and build nice applications. This was inspired by the post on a laravel + angularsingle page application on scotch.io (http://scotch.io/tutorials/php/create-a-laravel-and-angular-single-page-comment-application)
